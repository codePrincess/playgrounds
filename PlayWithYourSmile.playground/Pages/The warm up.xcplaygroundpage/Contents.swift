 It's time to get started. So we will create a little program which generates an output on the screen everytime we press a button. Not hard right? So let's go!

//: To get a nice and friendly UI, we set the background color to white. The default value is just black.

//: As we want to trigger our output with a button click, we need a button. So we create a button!
let button = UIButton(type: .roundedRect)
//: Then the button gets a nice and describing title
button.setTitle("Press me", for: .normal)
//: And a place to be displayed
button.frame = CGRect(x: 85, y: 400, width: 150, height: 30)
//: The button setup is done, so we just add it to the view as a subview

### Something very playground specific
 - - -
Now we have to do something very playground specific. In iOS it's super easy to add logic to touch events of controls. As the playground is not a full blown iOS app, we have to do a little workaround to get to our goal. So just notice that this class with it's only function helps the button to know what to do when it gets tapped.

Great! Now we have to define what the button should do everythime it getts tapped, or clicked :D
- We craete a label to show our output and give it a place to the displayed
- Then we create a random number between 0 and the length of our emoji-array
- We set the text into the label right next to an emoji from our array from a random position within the array
- And then add the label to the view for being able to see it on the
